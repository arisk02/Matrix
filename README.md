# Matrix

This project was me testing if I have mastered copy and move constructors and assignment operators, 
tested my knowledge of overloading operators, allocating and deallocating dynamic memory, as well as my
knowledge of pointers and header and source files. This was half way through my C++ course.

The project has a default constructor and a constructor with parameters, as well as a move and copy constructors
and assignment operators. It has an overloaded += operator that adds two matrices together. It has getters and
setters for entries in the matrices, and pointers to those entries.
